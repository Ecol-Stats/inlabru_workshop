# Welcome to the course!

-   Welcome to the `inlabru` workshop!
-   The goal of this workshop is to introduce new users to the `inlabru` software for Bayesian spatial modelling using the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA).
-   The workshop is intended for applied statisticians and quantitative ecologists who are interested in efficiently modelling spatial data- No prior knowledge of `R-INLA` is required.

# In preparation for the workshop

Participants are required to follow the next steps before the day of the workshop:

1.  Install [R-INLA](https://www.r-inla.org/download-install)

2.  Install `inlabru` (available from CRAN)

    ```{r}
    #| eval: false

    # Enable universe(s) by inlabru-org
    options(repos = c(
      inlabruorg = "https://inlabru-org.r-universe.dev",
      INLA = "https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/testing",
      CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
    ))

    # Install some packages
    install.packages("inlabru")
    ```

3.  Make sure you have the latest `R-INLA`, `inlabru` and `R` versions installed.

4.  Install the following libraries:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: hide

source("extract_practicals_libraries.R")

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

    if (file.exists("practicals_libraries.rds")) {
      libs_data <- readRDS("practicals_libraries.rds")
      
      # Libraries to exclude
      exclude_libs <- c("webexercises", "INLA", "inlabru", "knitr")
      
      # Filter out excluded libraries
      filtered_libs <- libs_data[!libs_data$Library %in% exclude_libs, ]
      
      if (nrow(filtered_libs) > 0) {

        cat("install.packages(c(\n")
        cat(paste0('  "', filtered_libs$Library, '"', collapse = ",\n"))
        cat("\n))")
        
      } else {
        cat("No libraries found after filtering.\n")
      }
    }
```
