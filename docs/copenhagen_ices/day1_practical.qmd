<font size="5"> **Aim of this practical:** </font> In this first practical we are going to look at some simple models

1.  A Gaussian model with simulated data
2.  A Linear mixed model
3.  A GLM model with random effects

we are going to learn:

-   How to fit some commonly used models with `inlabru`
-   How to explore the results
-   How to get predictions for missing data points
