<font size="5"> **Aim of this practical:** </font>

In this first practical we are going to look at some simple models

1.  A Gaussian model with simulated data

2.  A Linear mixed model

3.  A GLM model with random effects

We are going to learn:

-   How to fit some commonly used models with `inlabru`

-   How to explore the results

-   How to get predictions for missing data points
