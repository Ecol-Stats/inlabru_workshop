# Welcome to the course!

-   Welcome to the `inlabru` workshop!
-   The goal of this workshop is to introduce new users to the `inlabru` software for Bayesian spatial modelling using the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA). 
-   The workshop is intended for applied statisticians and quantitative ecologists who are interested in efficiently modelling spatial data- No prior knowledge of `R-INLA` is required.

# Learning Objectives for the workshop

At the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

-   Understand the `inlabru` workflow and software principles.
-   Fit commonly used models such as Linear models, LMM, GLM and GAMs using `inlabru`.
-   Describe different types of spatial data and fit appropriate spatial models.
-   Interpret model outputs and create spatial maps and predictions.
-   Implement a complete, reproducible spatial analysis workflow from data preparation to result visualization.
