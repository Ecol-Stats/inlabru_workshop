# Welcome to the course!

-   Welcome to the `inlabru` workshop!
-   The goal of this workshop is to introduce new users to the `inlabru` software for Bayesian spatial modelling using the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA).

# Learning Objectives for the workshop

At the end of the workshop, participants will have an understanding of:

-   The `inlabru` workflow and software principles.
-   The motivation for and the challenges of analysing and modelling spatial data.
-   Statistical models used to analyse spatial data.
-   The implementation of these models in the `inlabru` package

# Intended audience

The workshop aims to cater for participants with a range of different backgrounds, who is interested in analysing data with modern spatial statistical modelling approaches.

# Prerequisites

Participants should be familiar with the R environment, and general statistical approaches for modelling such as regression, analysis of (co)variance, and generalized linear models.

No knowledge of `R-INLA` or `inlabru` is required.
