## Outline

- Why spatial modelling?
- Why is spatial modelling computationally expensive?
- Different data types?
- Modelling in discrete space -- areal data
- Modelling in continuous space -- geo-referenced data
- Modelling continuous space -- spatial point process data

## Spatial modelling
accounting for spatia dependence

## Spatial modelling -- computations


## Types of spatial data

We can distinguish three types of spatial data 

Discrete space:
- data on a spatial grid (areal data)

Continuous space:
- geostatistical (geo-referenced) data 
- spatial point data

## Discrete space: areal data

- data on a (regular or irregular) spatial grid
- examples: number of individuals in a region, average rainfall in a province

- (originally geostatistical or point data; gridded for practical reasons)

## Continuous space: geostatistical data 

- phenomenon that is continuous in space
- examples: nutrient levels in soil, salinity in the sea
measurements at a given set of locations that are determined by surveyor

Observed response(s):
measurement(s) taken at given locations

## Continuous space: spatial point patterns
- patterns formed by locations of objects (individuals) in space (typically 2D)
- examples: locations of trees in a forest, groups of animals, earthquakes

Observed response(s):
x,y coordinates of points (individuals/groups)
maybe also properties of individuals/groups (â€œmarks")

## Take home message!

- all spatial models we discuss here are also special cases of the large class of Latent Gaussian models

- to account for spatial dependence in the data, different types of spatial terms have to be included in the model for different spatial data structures, but they are all approximated by an SPDE model  

- _inlabru_ provides an efficient and  unified  way to fit all these models!
